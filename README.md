# Random Email Generator
Are you tired of generating your own fictional email? Lazy to create your own generator? Say no more! Here is RANDOM EMAIL GENERATOR!

## Preface
I made this because I needed some mock emails to practice filtering data using Pandas. If I wanted to display my work, I had to have some mock emails and names to showcase to future employers. So creating this came to mind.
